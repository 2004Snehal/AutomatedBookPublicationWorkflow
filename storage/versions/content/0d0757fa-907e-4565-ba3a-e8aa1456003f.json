A hand fell upon his shoulder and turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa, a lock of her dark hair escaped from the thread of elastic vine that bound it, blew right back on the breeze like an eagle\u2019s feather, and her eyes, luminous and dark instead of meeting his, were fixed towards the point where he had been gazing\u2014the due-north sea line. \u201cLook!\u201d said Katafa.
