  "content": "They still threatened her. Some day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women, and instinct half whispered to him that just as he was drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided of its women and seeing the lagoon light they would come. Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization. To Dick there was no world beyond the world of water that ringed the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life like Katafa's, and yet even in that life, short as it was, he had learned to dread men and he had envisaged the foundation of all history\u2014man\u2019s instinct for war, rapine and destruction. Then gradually the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and pass, suddenly it vanished like a light blown out and as they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the lagoon water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders and, leaving the coral, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it. Layout 2",
