Behind him, the breakers of the open sea crashed and roared, scattering salty spray on the wind. Before him lay a stark contrast: a lagoon, serene as a mountain lake, stretching to the horizon \u2013 an infinite expanse of blue, dotted with the graceful dance of fishing gulls. This was the lagoon of Karolin.\n\nEnclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, this vast expanse of water was a sea unto itself. A tempestuous sea in the face of fierce winds, yet a tranquil, azure lake under gentle breezes. And, remarkably, it was *his* \u2013 this place where he had arrived only yesterday.\n\nHe surveyed the scene before him: women, children, youths \u2013 the entire tribe, bustling along the sun-drenched beach. Some cast nets into the shallows, others engaged in playful games, while still others tended to the *paraka* patches, their small gardens. All were now his people. The canoes, resting on the sand, belonged to him. The empty houses, once echoing with the activity of war canoes, were his to command.\n\nBut as his gaze shifted from the placid lagoon to the dormant canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning his back on the tranquil water, he faced the turbulent breakers of the outer beach and the vast northern sea. Somewhere, beyond the visible horizon, lay Palm Tree Island \u2013 beautiful as a dream, yet, he sensed, teeming with unseen dangers.\n\nLittle Tari, the son of Le Taioi, the net maker, sat nearby on the coral. The boy\u2019s understanding of the world was limited, but he knew one undeniable truth: the war had swept away the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable, without a leader. Then, just yesterday, a strange boat had appeared from the northern sea. In it were Katafa, the girl who had vanished years ago while fishing, and this enigmatic figure, seemingly sent by the gods to be their chief. Or so the women whispered.\n\nThe child cared little for gods, but he was captivated by this newcomer. Alone with him, and safely out of earshot of his mother, he voiced the question that burned in his young mind with disarming directness.\n\n\"Taori,\" little Tari asked, his voice clear and innocent, \"who are you?\" (*\u00e9 kamina tai*)\n\nCould Dick have truly answered? Would the child have grasped the strange and improbable tale he might have told? \"Tari, I come from a world beyond your knowing. My name. My name was Dick Lestrange. When I was smaller than you, I was left on that island you call Marua \u2013 Palm Tree \u2013 with an old sailor. We lived there, and Kearney \u2013 that was his name \u2013 taught me to fish and to spear. He made me toys, little ships unlike the canoes of these islands. Then, one day, Katafa arrived, the girl who was lost in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney died, and then we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She called me Taori. We loved each other, and we might have lived forever on Marua, had a ship not come. A ship filled with brutal men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to plunder the trees, then turned on their own, killing the white men aboard and burning the ship. We escaped in our small boat, taking with us everything we held dear, even the little ships, and steered for Karolin, guided by the faint glow of the lagoon light in the sky.\"\n\nBut he couldn't articulate all of that to Tari, or perhaps, he *couldn't*. The name \"Dick\" was a ghost in his memory, the language of his childhood a distant echo. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was fading, lost in the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor men long shipwrecked and alone, the past becomes blurred, obscured by the relentless sun and the vastness of the sea. For Dick, his true history began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. All that came before was consumed in the brilliant blaze of tropic light, the violent storms that ravaged the coconut groves, the heavy mists of the rainy seasons. Only the memory of the little ships Kearney had crafted for him remained vivid, tangible links to a forgotten life.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari *tatu*. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" the child replied, his attention already wavering. \"I ask as I breathe. But no big folk \u2013 *madyana* \u2013 ever answer the questions of Tari. Ai, the fish!\" His fleeting attention had been caught by the cries of children hauling in a net. He scampered off, his earlier curiosity forgotten in the excitement of the moment.\n\nDick turned his gaze northward once more. The child's simple question had stirred something deep within him, conjuring images of the schooner that had anchored at Palm Tree, only to be consumed by flames at the hands of the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself, fleeing in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He saw their arrival on this beach, just yesterday, and the swarm of women and children greeting him, hailing him as their divinely appointed chief.\n\nAs he stared into the distance, the memory of the men from whom they had escaped tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. There was no immediate threat. The men of Palm Tree possessed no canoes. But they *would* build canoes. Surely they would. And they would see the far-off mirror-like reflection of the Karolin lagoon blazing in the sky, just as he had seen it. And they would come. It might be a long time, but they *would* come.\n\nDick was almost one of them \u2013 *blook*, a *kanaka*, a savage. And yet, the white man remained within him. He could think ahead, analyze a situation, and imagine possibilities.\n\nThat was why, that morning, he had sent a canoe to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata \u2013 three old men, too old for war, but renowned canoe builders. That was why, when observing the tribe gathered before him, his eyes had lit up at the sight of nearly a hundred youths approaching fighting age. But beneath all the strategic calculation, fueling his daring, was his burning passion for Katafa, his other self, more precious than his own life \u2013 threatened, however subtly, but threatened nonetheless.\n\nWar canoes! Did he envision a defensive strategy, fighting off invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore? Or did he harbor a more audacious plan: to strike at the heart of the danger, before it could fully materialize? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder. He turned to find Katafa standing beside him. A lock of her dark hair, freed from the vine that bound it, danced in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the same point he had been studying \u2013 the due-north sea line.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa whispered.\n\nUnder certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through the phenomenon of mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now, once again, it was beginning to materialize, to take shape, to come to life \u2013 a mysterious stain low in the northern sky, a dull spot in the shimmering sea that gradually deepened and solidified. As if sketched by an unseen hand, the island appeared, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds unburdened by scientific explanations, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had fled. It was rising before them now, strangely, beyond the far sea line, as if to mock them.\n\nThey saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures distorted and monstrous, like the creatures of a nightmare. They felt again the wind filling the sail as the dinghy raced for safety on the open sea, and they heard again the bloodcurdling yells of the Melanesians, driven mad by rum stolen from the schooner they had set ablaze. And there, before them, lay the scene of that tragedy, a lovely picture that concealed the demons still lurking within.\n\nAs Dick gazed upon this loveliness, which was also a threat, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him \u2013 that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa \u2013 that was everything. And they *still* threatened her.\n\nSome day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to whisper the same warning as his instincts. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon's reflection in the sky, they would come. They had no women, and here, on Karolin, were women. He sensed, with a primal certainty, that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon, searching for an island to raid for its women, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf only he knew, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea \u2013 not only among savages, but among the wolves of civilization.\n\nTo Dick, there was no world beyond the water that",
