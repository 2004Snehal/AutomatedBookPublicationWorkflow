  "content": "Okay, I'm ready. I need the **original content** to work my magic on! Please provide the text you want me to transform. Once you give me the original content, I will:\n\n1.  **Analyze it:** I'll identify its strengths (e.g., clear points, good examples) and weaknesses (e.g., jargon, poor flow, lack of engagement).\n2.  **Consider the General Audience:** I'll assume a broad audience with varying levels of prior knowledge. This will inform my decisions about simplifying complex terms and providing sufficient context.\n3.  **Apply the Book Style:** This means a more narrative and descriptive approach, potentially including anecdotes, analogies, and a structured presentation.\n4.  **Maintain an Engaging Tone:** I'll use active voice, varied sentence structure, and rhetorical devices to keep the reader interested. I'll aim for a conversational but authoritative tone.\n5.  **Enhance Readability and Flow:** I'll break up long paragraphs, use headings and subheadings, and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.\n6.  **Maintain Core Message:** I will never change the fundamental meaning or facts presented in the original text.\n7.  **Add Narrative Elements:** I will weave in stories, examples, or relatable scenarios to make the content more compelling and memorable. I'll consider framing the information within a larger context.\n\nI'm eager to see the original content so I can get started!\n",
