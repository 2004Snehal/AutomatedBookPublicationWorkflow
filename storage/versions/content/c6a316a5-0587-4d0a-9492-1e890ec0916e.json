  "content": "The salt spray kissed Dick's face as he stood on the coral ledge, his gaze sweeping south. Behind him, the relentless rhythm of the outer sea crashed against the reef, scattering diamonds of spindrift on the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin shimmered, a vast expanse of water as tranquil as a lake. Forty miles of coral embraced this immense pond, a sea within a sea. In a tempest, it churned into a fury; under gentle breezes, it mirrored the azure sky. And it was his.\n\nHe had arrived only yesterday, yet already the island felt like his own. Women, children, and youths dotted the beach, their figures vibrant against the dazzling sun. They fished with nets, played ancient games, and tended to their paraka patches. They were his people. The sleek canoes resting on the sand, the empty houses where war canoes once lay poised on rollers \u2013 all his.\n\nBut as his gaze shifted from the tranquil lagoon to the empty canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. He turned his back on the gentle waters, facing the thunderous breakers of the outer beach and the vast, beckoning northern sea. Out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island whispered to be as beautiful as a dream, yet teeming with malevolent spirits.\n\nLittle Tari, the son of Le Taioi, the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, watching him. Tari, though young, understood the gravity of their situation. The men of Karolin had been lost to war, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable, without a leader, without protection. Then, yesterday, like a gift from the sea, a strange boat had appeared from the north, carrying Katafa, the girl who had been lost to the ocean years ago during a fishing trip, and this enigmatic newcomer. The women whispered that he was sent by the gods to be their chief, their ruler.\n\nThe child knew little of gods, nor did he particularly care. He was simply captivated by this powerful, new presence. Alone now with this extraordinary figure, and out of earshot of his mother, Tari dared to ask the question that burned in his small heart, speaking with the unadulterated simplicity of childhood.\n\n\u201cTaori,\u201d little Tari said, tilting his head, \u201cWho are you?\u201d ( *\u00e9 kamina tai* )\n\nCould Dick have truly answered? And even if he could, would the child have grasped the weight of the words, the strangeness of the journey that had brought him to this remote island, to this moment of profound responsibility?\n",
