  "content": "The salt spray kissed Dick's face as he stood on the coral ledge, gazing south. Behind him, the relentless breakers of the outer sea crashed against the reef, a constant, thunderous roar. Before him, a stark contrast: the lagoon of Karolin. An endless expanse of sapphire, tranquil as a mountain lake, shimmered under the tropical sun. Gulls wheeled and cried overhead, their calls echoing across the still water. This vast, forty-mile-wide circle of coral-enclosed sea was Karolin's heart. A fearsome tempest in a hurricane's grip, a placid, azure mirror in gentle breezes \u2013 and, incredibly, it was *his*.\n\nOnly yesterday, he had arrived on these shores. Now, scattered along the beach in the dazzling sunlight, the people of Karolin \u2013 women, children, youths \u2013 went about their lives. Some cast nets into the shallows, hoping for a catch. Others played age-old games in the sand, their laughter carried on the wind. Still others tended the paraka patches, coaxing sustenance from the earth. They were all his people. The sleek canoes, drawn up on the white sand, were his. The empty houses, where formidable war canoes once rested on their sturdy rollers, were his as well.\n\nHis gaze swept from the tranquil lagoon to the silent canoe houses, and a shadow flickered across his brow. Turning his back to the alluring calm, he faced the untamed fury of the outer beach and the vast, northern sea. Somewhere, beyond the horizon's hazy embrace, lay Palm Tree Island. Beautiful, whispered tales claimed, a paradise shimmering like a dream. But those whispers also carried a darker truth: it was a place swarming with devils.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat perched on a nearby piece of coral, watching him with wide, curious eyes. Tari, though young, understood the weight of their situation. The men of Karolin, swept away by the relentless tide of war, had left the women, boys, and children vulnerable, adrift without a leader. Then, like a gift from the gods themselves, yesterday this stranger had appeared from the northern sea, arriving in a strange boat alongside Katafa, the girl who had vanished years ago during a fishing trip, lost to the ocean's whim. The women said he was sent to be their chief, their protector. Tari knew little of gods and cared less. He was simply a child, alone with this fascinating newcomer, and beyond the reach of his mother's watchful ears. Emboldened by the moment, he voiced the question that burned within him, a question stripped bare of artifice, spoken with the pure simplicity of childhood.\n\n\"Taori,\" little Tari asked, his voice small but clear, \"who are you?\" ( *\u00e9 kamina tai* )\n\nCould Dick have truly answered? And, even if he could, would a child like Tari have understood the strange, complicated words that would have poured forth?\n",
